When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song
From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel
They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth
While the devil’s horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can’t be bleat
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
Toss a coin to Your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And brings you to mourn
He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came
He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He’s a friend of humanity
So give him the rest
That’s my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
Toss a coin to your Witcher
And friend of humanity
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
And friend of humanity
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
Toss a coin to your Witcher
A friend of humanity
